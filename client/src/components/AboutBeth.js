          I’ve been teaching preschool out of my home for over 35 years! It has been and continues to be such a joy to me!! Along with teaching preschool each year I look forward to summer where I provide Summer Fun Camps for children ages 3-7! It is something I truly look forward to each year!!
        </p>
        <p>
          This year, however, has been a little different with this CrAzZy coronavirus situation!! Due to this I’ve been unable to open up my home to these summer camps! It’s been a sad thing for me, as well as the children and parents who look forward to this each year!!
          So...I did a little brainstorming and came up with an option that I hope will help bridge the gap this year by providing a way to bring summer fun and creativity right into your own home!
          I’d like to introduce you to
          Miss Beth’s Creativity Kits!!
        </p>
        <p>
          Have fun, be creative and enjoy every minute along the way!! ❤️
